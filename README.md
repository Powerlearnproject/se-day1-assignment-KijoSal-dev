Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline focused on the systematic development of high quality software products using engineering principles, methods and tools.
Software engineering is important as it enables the creation of reliable, scalable and innovative software solutions that meet user needs

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The estbalishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements : gathering and documentating user needs and system requirements
Design: Creating high level detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation: Writing codes and building software according to design specifications
Testing : Conducting various tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment : Release of the software to users
Maintanenance: provide ongoing support, updates and enhancements of software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall : sequential approach with distinct phaes flowing downwards like a waterfall
Agile: iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change
Example of waterfall methodologies : construction of a builing 
Example of Agile methodologies : developing a new website 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: responsible for writing code and implementig software solutions
Quality assurance engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project manager: oversee the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated development environments (IDEs) ; software suites that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Example Visual studio
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Example Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges:
Tight deadlines: pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Changing requirements: requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.

Strategies to overcome the challenges:
Effective communication
Agile methodologies
Prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: testing individual components or modules of software
Intergration testing : testing intergration between different components or sub systems
System testing : testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance testing : testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models.
The importance in interacting with AI models helps to make your questions clear and specific, so that the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Translate this
Translate hello to French 

Improved prompt is more effective as use of keywords that guide AI towards the kind of response you want.
